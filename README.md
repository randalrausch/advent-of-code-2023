# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 Attempted Solutions

Ho ho ho, welcome to my humble repository of Advent of Code ... 'solutions'. As [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)) would say, "If you're here expecting pristine code and flawless solutions, you're in the wrong house."

**What's Advent of Code, you ask?** Well, it's an annual coding challenge that combines the joy of the holiday season with the agony of debugging bad code. Read more [here](https://adventofcode.com/about)

I've been a manager for too long and fear my software engineering skills are atrophying.  That bothers me.  Also, I really enjoy coding. So I'll be spending my holidays brushing up on my l33t skillz.

In this repository, you'll find my attempts to solve each day's coding puzzle, complete with all the mistakes, wrong turns, and suboptimal solutions you can handle.  
Perhaps it will bring you joy to laugh at my attempts.  Perhaps you will learn something.  Perhaps you can teach me something -- all comments, questions and jeers welcome!
