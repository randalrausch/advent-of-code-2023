# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 Potential Solutions: Where Bad Code Meets Festive Challenges!

Ho ho ho, welcome to my humble repository of Advent of Code ... 'solutions'. 🌟 As [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)) would say, "If you're here expecting pristine code and flawless solutions, you're in the wrong house."

**What's Advent of Code, you ask?** Well, it's an annual coding challenge that combines the joy of the holiday season with the agony of debugging bad code. 🎅👾 Read more [here]([https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/about))

I've been a manager for too long and fear my software engineering skills are atrophying.  That bothers me.  Also, I really enjoy coding.

In this repository, you'll find my attempts to solve each day's coding puzzle, complete with all the mistakes, wrong turns, and suboptimal solutions you can handle.  
Feel free to laugh at my coding mishaps and learn from my questionable decisions. 
Comments and jeers welcome. After all, 'tis the season to code and share the holiday spirit! 🎁
